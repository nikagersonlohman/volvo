# volvo
 
- rename or copy volvo.conf.sample
- currently only github authentication works (google does not allow selenium to logon "insecure browser")
- add all details (your username/password for developer portal, username/password for your volvo and your api-key from the developer portal)
- script only runs the vehiclelist and shows output as a proof of concept
